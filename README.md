#ðŸ¦‡ 1. BatGPT â€“ The Nocturnal AI Assistant
A chatbot that only works at night (or has a "night mode" personality). During the day, it responds sleepily or refuses to chat.

Fun Feature: At sunset, it fully wakes up and gives "nightly wisdom" or facts about nocturnal creatures.
Extra Twist: It could have a "cave mode" with dark UI.
