# BatGPT â€“ The Nocturnal AI Assistant ðŸ¦‡

BatGPT is a fun, experimental chatbot with a nocturnal twist. This AI assistant only works at night (or adopts a "night mode" personality) and responds sleepilyâ€”or even refuses to chatâ€”during the day.

## Overview

- **Nocturnal Mode:** At night, BatGPT fully wakes up and delivers "nightly wisdom" or fun facts about nocturnal creatures.
- **Daytime Behavior:** During the day, BatGPT may appear too sleepy to chat.
- **Cave Mode:** Activate a dark-themed UI (cave mode) for a more immersive nocturnal experience.

## Features

- **Nightly Wisdom:** Receive random, quirky facts about nocturnal animals and phenomena as the night sets in.
- **Sleepy Daytime Responses:** Experience a chatbot that playfully refuses to engage during daylight hours.
- **Dark UI (Cave Mode):** Toggle between a light and dark theme to match the nocturnal vibe.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
